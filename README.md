## What is f4rmhouse?

F4rmhouse is an all-in-one, open source platform for building useful agents. It provides every tool you need to create a modern agent with all its bells and MCP whistles. 

If you're non-technical you can use the official [website](https://f4rmhouse.com) which contains some paid features but has a very generous free tier. If you're not interested in that you can install a f4rmhouse client on your local system. 

## Prerequisites

* (optional) A running f4rmhouse API (we use the public one by default but you can run your own)
* Docker
* node
* f4cli -- the f4rmhouse cli tool that let's you publish tools to the public or a private tool repository

## Getting Started
