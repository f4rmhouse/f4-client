## What is f4rmhouse?

F4rmhouse is an all-in-one, open source platform for building useful agents. It provides every tool you need to create a modern agent with all its bells and MCP whistles. 

* [local/custom deployments](https://f4rmhouse.com): many teams want or need full control over their data and infrastructure. Self-hosting avoids vendor lock-in, ensures data never leaves your environment, and simplifies compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, etc.
* [shareable agents](https://f4rmhouse.com): We are the leaders of the Create Once Run Anywhere (CORA) movement in tech, we don't want agents to live in a single application but rather integrate into the apps you already use.
* [MCP plug-and-play](https://f4rmhouse.com): 
* [Model selection](https://f4rmhouse.com):
* [Extensible artifacts](https://f4rmhouse.com):
* [Agent swarms](https://f4rmhouse.com):
* [Deep customizability](https://f4rmhouse.com)

This is all mostly free to use on our official [website](https://f4rmhouse.com) which has a very generous free tier. If you're not interested in that you can install a f4rmhouse client on your local system. 

## Prerequisites

* (optional) A running f4rmhouse API (we use the public one by default but you can run your own)
* Docker
* node
* f4cli -- the f4rmhouse cli tool that let's you publish tools to the public or a private tool repository
